Channel your inner Bach, and harmonize with a machine learning model! Because of how wide it is, this app works best on desktop or a wide screen (sorry!)

The model is trained to fill in missing portions of 4-part Bach chorales. Here are a few things you can try:

- **Draw** a melody in any of the voices (painted with different colours). Each voice has a range and not all  voices can be drawn for all the pitches (the legend on the right side should help with that!)
- Have the model **infill** voices that are missing.
- Use the **section** tool to mask out a section of the resulting piece and have the model only infill that part
